          "body": "tl;dr in essence, yes an Attester needs that communication arc anyways, but the provisioning is out-of-scope without the anticipated rechartering\r\n\r\nIn principle, that is correct, I think. An Attester is provisioned by the same authority (e.g. a supply chain entity) that is also in charge of the corresponding endorsements provided by the Endorser role. The \"Provisioner\" role does not necessarily have to reside on the same entity as the Endorser role, but both typically share the same owner and they also have to convey massages when they do not reside on the same entity (mainly the Claims for Endorsements that are based on the data provisioned on the Attester).\r\n\r\nThe RATS architecture does not include a corresponding arc between Endorser(/Provisioner) in https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-rats-architecture-10.html#dataflow. During chartering of the WG the idea was to limit the scope of arcs between roles by excluding Attestation Provisioning Flows. Now, with the RATS architecture stabilizing, it becomes more apparent that there are pieces missing from that Figure 1. That is fine, as these can be described in other document.\r\n\r\nDAA is a kind of an outlier that - if one looks at it closely - needs an Arc coming from that Provisioning scope even on the operational level that is in scope of the Attestation \"Evidence\" (and its friends) Flows. Does that shed a different light on the phrasing?",

And yes, an AIK (Attestation Identity Key) in TPM 1.2 terminology, or AK (Attestation Key) in TPM 2.0 terminology, can be such a \"Secret\". The \"Secret ID\" basically is a key identifier/ID, e.g., the fingerprint/hash of such a key or the public part of the AK. The TPM FAPI uses key paths, such as \"HS/SRK/RSASignKey\". These are also valid key/secret identifiers/IDs. There is no official (unique) way of identifying keys, except for the FAPI key -- but: You need to use the FAPI for that purpose which is not available on embedded devices with no OS (because it needs at least a filesystem). In summary, it can be stated that \"Secret IDs\" are application-specific.\r\n\r\nNow, what is the matter with \"Authentication Secret\" and \"Authentication Secret ID\"?\r\nIn a later draft I replaced \"Secret (ID)\" with \"Authentication Secret (ID)\" intentionally, after talking to a crypto colleague. \"Authentication Secret\" is more specific than just \"secret\". And, in fact, its purpose is to provide authentication, i.e. evidence must provide the security property of \"authentication\", so that one knows it originates from a valid/specific source, e.g. TPM. This can also be some kind of group key (or DAA key).\r\n\r\n* \"Authentication Secret\": This element must be present in the attesting environment as it signs evidence (and a digital signature provides integrity and *authentication*).\r\n* \"Authentication Secret ID(s)\": This element must be mandatory as it identifies the \"Authentication Secret(s)\".",

      "body": "**General questions**: \r\n1. What is the real motivation of this draft?\r\n2. The flows represent only boot time measurements. What about runtime measurements (e.g., RTMR in TDX or REM in CCA)? \r\n3. There is no discussion on how deep the nonce goes in the Layered Attester. What is the assumption here?\r\n4. What is the exact difference between recentness and freshness?\r\n5. What is the exact difference between the Endorsements and Reference Values? \r\n6. Which certain types of relay attacks can scrambling avoid? \r\n\r\n**Specific questions/comments**:\r\n\r\n> Sec. 1 \"The reference models defined can also be applied to the conveyance of other Conceptual Messages in RATS.\"\r\n> Sec. 1 \"the methods described can also be applied to the conveyance of, for example, Endorsements or Attestation Results.\"\r\n> Sec. 7 \"the intention of this document is in support of future work that applies the presented models to the conveyance of other Conceptual Messages, namely Attestation Results, Endorsements, Reference Values, or Appraisal Policies.\"\r\n\r\nThis is repeated at least 3 times in the draft. Can you justify this claim by presenting at least one example for each of those?\r\n\r\n> Sec. 2.1: \"This conveyance can also be \"Local\", if the Verifier role is part of the same entity as the Attester role\"\r\n\r\nSo your definition of \"Local Attestation\" is independent of where the Relying Party is?\r\n\r\n> Sec. 3: \"prevent inconsistencies ...\"\r\n> Sec 3: \"avoid text clones and to avoid the danger of subtle discrepancies\" \r\n\r\nWith some interesting stuff out of scope, is it really the only motivation to write this draft? The draft is at such a high level of abstraction, I wonder if there are really any subtle discrepancies/inconsistencies this draft can help avoid. Can you give some examples of such subtle discrepancies? \r\n\r\n> Sec. 4: \"integral\" \r\n\r\nWhat is it? Can you point me to a reference which uses \"integral\" in the sense of integrity?\r\n\r\n> Sec. 4: \"The signature may be symmetric, such as an HMAC\" \r\n\r\nMAC is not a signature! \r\n\r\n> Sec. 4: \"This (authentication) ... may be achieved by using a confidential channel by means of encryption.\" \r\n\r\nEncryption by itself does not provide authentication. \r\n\r\n> Sec. 5: \"Evidence Protection\" \r\n\r\nThis seems redundant. With \"Attestation Evidence Authenticity\", why is it required? \r\n\r\n> Sec. 6: \"(a) determining recentness, (b) determining freshness, or (c) provide replay protection. Examples include:\r\n      Nonces that are used to protect from replay attacks\"\r\n\r\nWhat is the exact difference between recentness and freshness? Can you give clear examples of cases when one of them holds while the other one does not? I think nonces provide all of them. Why do you specifically mention replay protection _only_? \r\n\r\n> Sec. 6: \"This specific type of Claims is used to appraise Claims incorporated in Evidence.\"\r\n\r\nSomething seems to be missing here \r\n\r\n> Sec. 6: \"For example, Reference Values MAY be Reference Integrity Measurements (RIM) or assertions that are implicitly trusted because they are signed by a trusted authority (see Endorsements in [RFC9334]).\" \r\n\r\nThis seems to say that Endorsements are also Reference Values: is this what you mean here? What is the exact difference between the Endorsements and Reference Values? \r\n\r\n> Sec. 6: \"Claim Selection\" \r\n\r\nseems a misnomer as well as wrongly defined term. Isn't is something desired/requested by the Verifier?\r\n\r\n> Sec. 10: \"This extra information can be used to scramble the Nonce in order to\r\n   counter certain types of relay attacks.\" \r\n\r\nWhich certain types of relay attacks and how? Give more details. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Editorial**\r\n\r\n- Sec 1: Second paragraph is basically useless. There is no need to have a summary of a single paragraph just presented. \r\n- Introduction could already introduce the three types of Interaction Models. They are currently only introduced in Sec. 7 which is too late. ",

      "body": "The Attester boots up and thereby produces Claims about its boot state and its operational state. Claims are produced by all Attesting Environments of an Attester. Event Logs can accompany produced Claims and provide an event trail of security-relevant events that can be observed or collected by Attesting Environments. \n\nA Challenge/Response remote attestation procedure is typically initiated by a Verifier via sending a remote attestation request to an Attester. A request includes a Handle, a list of Attestation Environment IDs, and a Claim Selection for all Attesting Environments or dedicated Claim Selections for sets of Attesting Environments.\n\nIn the Challenge/Response model, a handle is composed of qualifying extra data typically in the form of a practically infeasible to guess cryptographically strong random number (nonce) or an Epoch Marker {{-epoch-markers}}.\nA Verifier-generated nonce is intended to demonstrate Evidence freshness via recentness and to prevent replay attacks.\n\nUltimately, the list of Attesting Environment IDs selects the attestation keys via which an Attester is requested to sign its Attestation Evidence.\nCorrespondingly, a particular set of Evidence originating from certain Attesting Environments in a composite device can be requested via multiple Attesting Environment IDs.\nMethods to acquire Attesting Environment IDs or mappings between Attesting Environments to Attesting Environment IDs are out-of-scope of this document.\n\nBased on the provided Handle, the Attesting Environment IDs, and collected Claims, an Attester produces signed Evidence. That is, it digitally signs the Handle and the collected Claims with a cryptographic secret identified by the Attesting Environment ID. This is done once per Attesting Environment. The Attester conveys signed Evidence as well as all accompanying data, such as Event Logs, back to the Verifier.\n\nWhile it is crucial that Claims, the Handle, and the Attesting Environment IDs MUST be cryptographically bound to the signature of Evidence, they MAY be presented obfuscated, encrypted, or cryptographically blinded.\nFor further reference see section {{security-and-privacy-considerations}}.\n\nAs soon as the Verifier receives the Evidence, it can begin the appraisal procedure.\nFor this purpose, the Verifier checks the signature, the Attesting Environment ID, and the Handle, and then appraises the Claims.\nAppraisal procedures are application-specific and can be conducted via comparison of the Claims with corresponding Reference Values, such as Reference Integrity Measurements, conditions that have to be met by Evidence, such as the presence of certain Claims, and the application of Appraisal Policy for Evidence.\nThe final outputs of the Verifier are Attestation Results. Attestation Results constitute new Claim Sets about the properties and characteristics of an Attester, which enables Relying Parties, for example, to then assess an Attester's trustworthiness.\n\n--------------------\n\nThe Attester boots up and thereby produces Claims about its boot state and its operational state. Event Logs may accompany the produced Claims and provide an event trail of security-critical events in the system. Claims are produced by all Attesting Environments of an Attester system.\n\nThe Challenge/Response remote attestation procedure is initiated by the Verifier by sending a remote attestation request to the Attester. A request includes a Handle, an optional list of Attestation Key IDs, and an optional Claim Selection.\n\nIn the Challenge/Response model, the Handle is composed of qualifying data in the form of a practically infeasible to guess nonce, such as a cryptographically strong random number.\nThe Verifier-generated nonce is intended to guarantee Evidence freshness and to prevent replay attacks.\n\nThe list of Attestation Key IDs selects the attestation keys with which the Attester is requested to sign the attestation Evidence.\nEach selected key is uniquely associated with an Attesting Environment of the Attester.\nAs a result, a single Attestation Key ID identifies a single Attesting Environment.\nCorrespondingly, a particular set of Evidence originating from a particular Attesting Environment in a composite device can be requested via multiple Attestation Key IDs.\nMethods to acquire Attestation Key IDs or mappings between Attesting Environments to Attestation Key IDs are out of scope of this document.\n\nThe Attester selects Claims based on the specified Claim Selection, which is defined by the Verifier.\nThe Claim Selection determines the Collected Claims, which may be a subset of all the available Claims.\nIf the Claim Selection is omitted, then all available Claims on the Attester MUST be used to create corresponding Evidence.\nFor example, when performing a boot integrity evaluation, a Verifier may only request specific claims about the Attester, such as Evidence about the BIOS/UEFI and firmware that the Attester booted up, without including information about all currently running software.\n\nWith the Handle, the Attestation Key IDs, and the Collected Claims, the Attester produces signed Evidence. That is, it digitally signs the Handle and the Collected Claims with a cryptographic secret identified by the Attestation Key ID. This is done once per Attesting Environment which is identified by the particular Attestation Key ID. The Attester communicates the signed Evidence as well as all accompanying Event Logs back to the Verifier.\n\nThe Claims, the Handle, and the Attester Identity information (i.e., the Authentication Secret) MUST be cryptographically bound to the signature of Evidence. These MAY be presented obfuscated, encrypted, or cryptographically blinded.\nFor further reference see section {{security-and-privacy-considerations}}.\n\nUpon receiving the Evidence and Event Logs, the Verifier validates the signature, Attester Identity, and Handle, and then appraises the Claims.\nClaim appraisal is driven by Policy and takes Reference Values and Endorsements as input.\nThe Verifier outputs Attestation Results. Attestation Results create new Claim Sets about the properties and characteristics of an Attester, which enable Relying Parties to assess an Attester's trustworthiness.\n",

E.g., the PubSub server.  \r\n\r\n(2) This seems to be a very large scope change to an already adopted document.  Likely there needs to be discussion on the list of the meaning of the functionality.\r\n\r\n(3)  There is draft-birkholz-rats-network-device-subscription which includes items like Subscription identifier.  However this PR doesn't describe the relationship to draft-birkholz-rats-network-device-subscription.\r\n\r\n(4)  Basic questions on capability discovery (like how to know what streams are available for subscription) are already handled elsewhere in places like NETCONF, RESTCONF, etc.  Do we need additional documents describing these functions specific to RATS?",
