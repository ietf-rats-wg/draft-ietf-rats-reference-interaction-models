          "body": "tl;dr in essence, yes an Attester needs that communication arc anyways, but the provisioning is out-of-scope without the anticipated rechartering\r\n\r\nIn principle, that is correct, I think. An Attester is provisioned by the same authority (e.g. a supply chain entity) that is also in charge of the corresponding endorsements provided by the Endorser role. The \"Provisioner\" role does not necessarily have to reside on the same entity as the Endorser role, but both typically share the same owner and they also have to convey massages when they do not reside on the same entity (mainly the Claims for Endorsements that are based on the data provisioned on the Attester).\r\n\r\nThe RATS architecture does not include a corresponding arc between Endorser(/Provisioner) in https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-rats-architecture-10.html#dataflow. During chartering of the WG the idea was to limit the scope of arcs between roles by excluding Attestation Provisioning Flows. Now, with the RATS architecture stabilizing, it becomes more apparent that there are pieces missing from that Figure 1. That is fine, as these can be described in other document.\r\n\r\nDAA is a kind of an outlier that - if one looks at it closely - needs an Arc coming from that Provisioning scope even on the operational level that is in scope of the Attestation \"Evidence\" (and its friends) Flows. Does that shed a different light on the phrasing?",

And yes, an AIK (Attestation Identity Key) in TPM 1.2 terminology, or AK (Attestation Key) in TPM 2.0 terminology, can be such a \"Secret\". The \"Secret ID\" basically is a key identifier/ID, e.g., the fingerprint/hash of such a key or the public part of the AK. The TPM FAPI uses key paths, such as \"HS/SRK/RSASignKey\". These are also valid key/secret identifiers/IDs. There is no official (unique) way of identifying keys, except for the FAPI key -- but: You need to use the FAPI for that purpose which is not available on embedded devices with no OS (because it needs at least a filesystem). In summary, it can be stated that \"Secret IDs\" are application-specific.\r\n\r\nNow, what is the matter with \"Authentication Secret\" and \"Authentication Secret ID\"?\r\nIn a later draft I replaced \"Secret (ID)\" with \"Authentication Secret (ID)\" intentionally, after talking to a crypto colleague. \"Authentication Secret\" is more specific than just \"secret\". And, in fact, its purpose is to provide authentication, i.e. evidence must provide the security property of \"authentication\", so that one knows it originates from a valid/specific source, e.g. TPM. This can also be some kind of group key (or DAA key).\r\n\r\n* \"Authentication Secret\": This element must be present in the attesting environment as it signs evidence (and a digital signature provides integrity and *authentication*).\r\n* \"Authentication Secret ID(s)\": This element must be mandatory as it identifies the \"Authentication Secret(s)\".",

E.g., the PubSub server.  \r\n\r\n(2) This seems to be a very large scope change to an already adopted document.  Likely there needs to be discussion on the list of the meaning of the functionality.\r\n\r\n(3)  There is draft-birkholz-rats-network-device-subscription which includes items like Subscription identifier.  However this PR doesn't describe the relationship to draft-birkholz-rats-network-device-subscription.\r\n\r\n(4)  Basic questions on capability discovery (like how to know what streams are available for subscription) are already handled elsewhere in places like NETCONF, RESTCONF, etc.  Do we need additional documents describing these functions specific to RATS?",
